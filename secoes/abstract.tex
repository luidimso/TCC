With the growing advancement of academic formation and universities, academic events become more and more frequent. Given this, the Instituto Federal Fluminense has the Eventos IFF website, however, it does not have a mobile application. The market offers numerous solutions that meet the demand for event management. However, the internal development of a solution enables integration with the internal services of Eventos IFF, enabling greater customization of the application, as well as greater adaptation to the institution's characteristics. Therefore, it was decided that the development of a mobile application for the platform would be more adequate to the institution's needs. The project was structured in a methodology aiming to obtain better results and validations. As a result, an interactive prototype was built structuring the proposed solution, aiming to guide the application development, bringing the vision of how the solution was designed and designed. The solution proved to be viable, adding agility and efficiency in the event management process by IFF Events.
